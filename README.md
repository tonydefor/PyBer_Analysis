# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Using Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib, we create a variety of charts that showcased the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations you produce will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results

Our analysis produced the below outcome

As we can see based on our summarization, Urban areas had the highest total number of rides and drivers as well as the largest number of total fares. 
It is also stands out as well that the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver was higher in rural areas, possibly due to drivers having to travel a farther distance to pick up riders.

Based on our attached png file as noted above, we can present our analysis to the CEO; V.Isualize and conclude that:

- Hiring more drivers in rural areas could help increase revenue since the average fare per driver is much higher compares to the other areas.

- Majority of rides occurs in urban areas, hence, the fares could also be increased to remain competitive in the space without hindering the ability to retain and generate new business with rides.
